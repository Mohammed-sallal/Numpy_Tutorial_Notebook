## Topics Covered

This tutorial is a deep dive into the essentials of NumPy, including:

-   **Why NumPy?**: <br>
      Understanding the performance benefits of vectorization over traditional Python lists.
    
-   **Array Fundamentals**:
    -   Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays from scratch.
    -   Using `arange`, `linspace`, `zeros`, `ones`, and the `random` module.
    -   Understanding data types (`dtype`) and type casting (`astype`).
      
-   **Manipulation & Indexing**:
    -   Slicing, fancy indexing, and boolean masking.
    -   Reshaping, splitting, and concatenating arrays.
    -   The difference between a **View** and a **Copy** of an array.
      
-   **Broadcasting**: <br>
      etailed explanation of how NumPy handles operations on arrays of different shapes.
    
-   **Universal Functions (Ufuncs)**:<br>
      Element-wise operations for fast and efficient computation.
    
-   **Aggregations & Statistics**: <br>
      Calculating `mean`, `sum`, `min`, and `max` across different axes.
    
-   **Linear Algebra**: <br>
      Core functions like dot products, transpose, inverse, and determinants.
